## Let's talk ML in Prague

Let's talk ML organizes regular student meetups at the Czech Technical University in Prague.\
Each meetup consists of 2 short talks regarding interesting papers in ML.

I started it with my friend Václav Ostrožlík in the summer of 2016 and it has nicely picked up since then.
